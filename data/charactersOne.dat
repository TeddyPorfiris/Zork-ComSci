Initial Dialogue: Hey! Do you want to hear about one of the updates I added to your space jet? (yes/no)
Answer One: yes
Answer Two: no
Response One: Great! In an event where there is a large amount of enemies surrounding you, I've added a feature where if you type in the command "use self-destruct button", It will eject you out of your ship, and then activate the ship self destruct sequence. The explosion will blow up the enemies while you are a safe distance away. So that's all I have to say. Bye!
Response Two: Oh ok maybe next time. Bye!
